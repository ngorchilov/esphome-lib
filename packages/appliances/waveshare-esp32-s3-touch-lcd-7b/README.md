# Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B

This appliance provides the display subsystem of the Waveshare
ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7B (touch version, SKU 31726):

- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8
- 16 MB flash and 8 MB octal PSRAM
- 1024 x 600 RGB565 display
- GT911 capacitive touchscreen at I2C address `0x5D`
- CH32V003 I/O extension at I2C address `0x24`
- controllable backlight with brightness and full on/off support

The board's I/O extension is not the CH422G used by some other Waveshare LCD
boards. ESPHome supports it natively through `waveshare_io_ch32v003`.

## Local Usage

```yaml
packages:
  - !include
    file: ../packages/appliances/waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-lcd-7b.yaml
    vars:
      waveshare_lcd7b:
        backlight:
          id: display_backlight
          name: Display Backlight

lvgl:
  rotation: 0
  buffer_size: 25%
```

## Remote Package Usage

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: display-panel
  friendly_name: Display Panel

packages:
  - url: https://github.com/ngorchilov/esphome-lib
    ref: main
    refresh: 0d
    files:
      - path: packages/appliances/waveshare-esp32-s3-touch-lcd-7b.yaml
        vars:
          waveshare_lcd7b:
            backlight:
              id: display_backlight
              name: Display Backlight

light:
  - id: !extend display_backlight
    restore_mode: RESTORE_DEFAULT_ON

lvgl:
  rotation: 0
  buffer_size: 25%
```

Pass both the backlight `id` and `name` when an application extends it. Replacing
only the id leaves the appliance's default entity name, `Backlight`.

The display defaults to `update_interval: never` and
`auto_clear_enabled: false`, as required by LVGL. Applications using ESPHome's
display drawing engine instead may override both values under
`waveshare_lcd7b.display`.

The appliance owns the display and touch hardware, while the application owns
the `lvgl` block, including rotation, buffer sizing, pages, widgets, and idle
behavior. With one display and one touchscreen, LVGL selects both automatically.

Applications may target these stable default ids:

- `waveshare_lcd7b_display`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_touchscreen`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_backlight`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_backlight_output`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_backlight_power`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_i2c`
- `waveshare_lcd7b_io`

The display, touchscreen, and backlight entity ids may be replaced through the
corresponding `waveshare_lcd7b` objects. Display drawing applications can also
set `display.update_interval` and `display.auto_clear_enabled`.

## Fixed Wiring

| Function | Connection |
| --- | --- |
| I2C SDA / SCL | GPIO8 / GPIO9 |
| Touch interrupt | GPIO4 |
| Display DE / PCLK | GPIO5 / GPIO7 |
| Display VSYNC / HSYNC | GPIO3 / GPIO46 |
| Red data | GPIO1, GPIO2, GPIO42, GPIO41, GPIO40 |
| Green data | GPIO39, GPIO0, GPIO45, GPIO48, GPIO47, GPIO21 |
| Blue data | GPIO14, GPIO38, GPIO18, GPIO17, GPIO10 |
| Touch reset | Extension pin 1 |
| Backlight enable | Extension pin 2 |
| Display reset | Extension pin 3 |

The RGB timing follows Waveshare's current 7B driver: 24 MHz pixel clock,
HSYNC 162/152/48, and VSYNC 45/13/3 for pulse/back/front porch.

Extension pin 6 is intentionally left unassigned. Waveshare's current driver
sets the RGB display enable GPIO to `-1` and does not drive that extension pin.

This appliance intentionally owns only the display subsystem. Other onboard
interfaces remain available to consuming firmware. GPIO6 is a general exposed
pin on this board; it is not modeled as an onboard buzzer.
