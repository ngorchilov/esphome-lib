# esphome-lib

Reusable ESPHome firmware for switches, meters, climate devices, radios and controller boards.
Use a complete [device](devices/README.md) from the ESPHome dashboard, or compose your own
application from the [hardware appliances](#hardware-appliances) and [modules](packages/modules/README.md).
These are ESPHome firmware configurations, not Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard cards.

## Start With A Device

Create an ESPHome dashboard entry and replace its YAML with a package include. For example:

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: laundry-dehumidifier
  friendly_name: Laundry Dehumidifier

packages:
  - url: https://github.com/ngorchilov/esphome-lib
    ref: main
    refresh: 0d
    files:
      - devices/jummico-dehumidifier.yaml
```

Wi-Fi devices use `wifi_ssid` and `wifi_password` from your dashboard's `secrets.yaml` unless you
provide explicit [networking credentials](packages/modules/networking/README.md). Choose firmware
for the actual PCB/module, not only the product's retail name. Validate before installing:

```sh
esphome config laundry-dehumidifier.yaml
```

Use the dashboard's Install action to build and deploy. First-time flashing may need serial access;
[kickstart firmware](kickstart/README.md) is available for supported boards. Disconnect mains power
before attaching a serial programmer; a low-voltage programming header does not prove isolation.
Keep a recovery method available, especially when changing board targets, pins or networking.

Package parameters belong under the selected file's `vars`. This changes a relay's HA role:

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: room-light
  friendly_name: Room Light

packages:
  - url: https://github.com/ngorchilov/esphome-lib
    ref: main
    refresh: 0d
    files:
      - path: devices/sonoff-basic-r4.yaml
        vars:
          entity:
            type: light
            magic_switch:
              detect_missing_pulses: true
```

For a local checkout placed beside the dashboard YAML, use the same package and vars:

```yaml
substitutions:
  name: laundry-dehumidifier
  friendly_name: Laundry Dehumidifier

packages:
  - !include esphome-lib/devices/jummico-dehumidifier.yaml
```

Local custom-component development also needs `ESPHOME_LIB_SOURCE` set to the checkout's absolute
`components` directory. Remote consumers should leave it unset. See [local validation](tests/README.md#local-components).

## Settings And Requirements

- [Device parameters and prerequisites](devices/README.md): profiles, entity roles, calibration,
  radio fans, water meters and HA dependencies.
- [Networking](packages/modules/networking/README.md): Wi-Fi, Ethernet, dual interfaces, offline
  operation, API/OTA and clocks. API encryption and OTA passwords are opt-in, not enabled by default.
- [ESPHome version requirements](packages/README.md): the highest requirement from included
  packages wins. Do not override `esphome.min_version` directly.
- [Module contracts](packages/modules/README.md): pins, relay control, energy monitoring and
  reusable behavior. An appliance includes its board; do not add a second board package.

Firmware inherits INFO logging from the base. Change it in your dashboard with `logger.level`
or `substitutions.log_level`; device packages do not choose verbosity for you. Keep any hardware
`logger.baud_rate: 0` requirement: enabling serial logs can interfere with a connected peripheral.

This library follows moving `main`, including its own external components. Pinning only a package
does not create a reproducible release snapshot. Validate dashboard configurations when updating,
and preserve installed `name`/`friendly_name`, entity IDs and explicit customizations.

## Device Catalog

The references below describe supported configuration choices, not electrical certification.
The repository's config tests do not prove every hardware revision. Hardware-specific cautions in
the linked YAML and appliance documentation take precedence. The irrigation controller is explicitly
a bench draft; products with the same name can contain different modules or datapoints.

### Relays, Sockets And Lights

Single-relay switches and sockets use the [relay entity API](devices/README.md#relay-devices).
Multi-channel products have per-channel settings; ceiling lights and the garage opener provide
their own native entities rather than that relay API.

## Validation And Status

The config-test baseline is ESPHome **2026.8.2**; that is not a universal minimum. Minimum tool
version, successful configuration validation, successful firmware compilation, hardware verification
and a product's published firmware version are separate facts. An unpublished edit does not imply
a new release number. A passing configuration or build is never proof that a valve, relay or motor
will behave correctly on a particular board.

[Validation instructions](tests/README.md) cover config-only tests, local components and focused
C++ tests. Routine YAML/substitution changes need `esphome config`, not a full firmware build.
An actual installation still requires a build. This library does not replace hardware interlocks,
overcurrent protection or the manufacturer's installation requirements.

[Tuya data models](data-models/tuya/README.md) preserve cloud schemas and extracted stock settings.
A cloud datapoint model alone does not prove the presence of a serial Tuya MCU.
